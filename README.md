svg-pan-zoom library 1.3.2
==========================

JavaScript for panning and zooming an SVG image from the mouse and programmatically.

 The SVGPan library was intended for use inside
 an SVG by manually adding an xlink:href script tag.

 The svg-pan-zoom library builds on the SVGPan library,
 adding the ability to control panning and zooming of
 any SVG included in an HTML document, without needing 
 to manually add a script element to the SVG.

 svg-pan-zoom features the following capabilities:
  * Panning based on mouse events and via JavaScript
  * Zooming based on mouse events (using the wheel) and via JavaScript
  * Object dragging based on mouse events

  Note that the SVG should have a top-level 'g' element
  with the id 'viewport' to enable zooming for the entire SVG. 
  If the specified SVG does not have this element, it will
  use the first 'g' element.

 See a [github pages demo](http://ariutta.github.io/svg-pan-zoom/).

How To Use
----------

To use, reference the svg-pan-zoom.js file in your page and call the init method, optionally with arguments:

```js
svgPanZoom.init({
  'selector': '#my-svg', // optional selector. If left blank, svg-pan-zoom will look for the first SVG document in your HTML document.
  'panEnabled': true, // optional. values must be true or false. default is true.
  'zoomEnabled': true, // optional. values must be true or false. default is true.
  'dragEnabled': false, // optional. values must be true or false. default is false.
  'zoomScaleSensitivity': 0.2, // optional. values must be scalar. default is 0.2.
  'minZoom': 0.5, // optional. values must be scalar. default is 0.5.
  'maxZoom': 10 // optional. values must be scalar. default is 10.
});
```

To programmatically control pan and zoom:

```js
svgPanZoom.pan([selector], direction); // selector is optional. direction must be one of up, right, left or down.

svgPanZoom.zoom({
  'selector': '#my-svg', // optional selector. If left blank, svg-pan-zoom will look for the first SVG document in your HTML document.
  'scale': 2 // required. values must be scalar.
});

svgPanZoom.zoomIn([selector]); // selector is optional. control zoom increment with "setZoomScaleSensitivity" method.

svgPanZoom.zoomOut([selector]); // selector is optional. control zoom increment with "setZoomScaleSensitivity" method.

svgPanZoom.resetZoom([selector]); // selector is optional.
```

To programmatically enable/disable pan, zoom or drag:

```js
svgPanZoom.enablePan();
svgPanZoom.disablePan();

svgPanZoom.enableZoom();
svgPanZoom.disableZoom();

svgPanZoom.enableDrag();
svgPanZoom.disableDrag();
```

 You can configure the default enabled/disabled state of pan/zoom/drag
 with the variables listed in the CONFIGURATION section of the file.
